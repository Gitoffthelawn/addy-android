<p>ðŸŽ¨ Moved to MD3 design<br />- The app got a slightly different but more vibrant color palette<br />- Enable "use dynamic colors" in the appearance settings of the app to let it blend in with your system theme (Android 12 or higher required).

<p>ðŸ“ƒ Added the "Run rule on" options for creating rules&nbsp;<br />ðŸ•· Fixed a bug where folding/unfolding your foldable while creating a rule would reset the screen<br />ðŸ•· Fixed a bug where the app would crash when coming back to it after having it idle for a certain amount of time<br />âœ¨ The number of API requests that are made is now reduced.<br />âœ¨ Performance improvements and other things I might have forgot to make the app even smoother</p>
