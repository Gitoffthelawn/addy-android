## Characteristics

> Exciting ✨

- A unique, sexy and sleek design, based on the [Material Design](https://material.io/) language
- Support for Deep Link to easily deactivate aliases from the email banner
- Lock the app using Biometrics
- Enable error logging to *locally* store exceptions for easy troubleshooting
- Widgets!

> Seriously 👓

- **Security**.
  - Encrypted preferences, your API key and other AnonAddy related settings are securely stored on your device using the [AndroidX crypto library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/security)
  - No stats, buried points or Device IDs, or even crash reporting (so if you get a crash, please share the crash info with me >_<).
  - I am forgoing the convenient third-party collection SDK and various stats just so you can use it with confidence.
  **What's yours is yours**.

## Download

Developer-led download channels:
- Google Play
  - ⚠️Note: this version charges but the code is identical, so if you'd like to buy the author a cup of tea (or if you're more headstrong) then go here and download it, otherwise please choose another source :)
- [Gitlab release](https://gitlab.com/anonaddy-ext/anonaddy-android/-/releases): Always stay up to date!
- F-Droid (release planned)

All other channels are not developer-driven, so please screen them carefully before downloading and using them.

## UI
- Designed by my lovely UI guru @JustPlayingHard (💙)
  - Anything you think doesn't work well is my bad as I recreated the UI drafts into XML.
