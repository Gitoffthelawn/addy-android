## Requirements

> AnonAddy

- AnonAddy v0.2.10 or higher (current version of AnonAddy for Android has been tested with v0.2.10)

> Android

- Android 6.0 or higher

## Characteristics

> Exciting ✨

- Connect to the [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com/) instance or your own hosted instance
- A unique, sexy and sleek design, based on the [Material Design](https://material.io/) language
- Support for Deep Link to easily deactivate aliases from the email banner
- Lock the app using Biometrics
- Enable error logging to *locally* store exceptions for easy troubleshooting
- Widgets!

> Seriously 👓

- **Security**.
  - Encrypted preferences, your API key and other AnonAddy related settings are securely stored on your device using the [AndroidX crypto library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/security)
  - No stats, buried points or Device IDs, or even crash reporting (so if you get a crash, please share the crash info with me >_<).
  - I am forgoing the convenient third-party collection SDK and various stats just so you can use it with confidence.
  **What's yours is yours**.

 > Manage (add, edit, delete)

- Aliases
- Recipients
- Domains
- Usernames

## Download

Developer-led download channels:

>Recommended (access to beta's, automatic updates and support me :) )
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.stjin.anonaddy)
  - ⚠️Note: this version charges but the code is identical, so if you'd like to buy the author a cup of tea (or if you're more headstrong) then go here and download it, otherwise please choose another source :)

>Other releases
- [Gitlab release](https://gitlab.com/Stjin/anonaddy-android/-/releases)
- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/host.stjin.anonaddy) (release planned)

All other channels are not developer-driven, so please screen them carefully before downloading and using them.

## UI
- Designed by my lovely UI guru @JustPlayingHard (💙)
  - Anything you think doesn't work well is my bad as I recreated the UI drafts into XML.
