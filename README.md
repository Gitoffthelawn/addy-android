## Requirements

> AnonAddy

- AnonAddy v0.7.4 or higher (current version of AnonAddy for Android has been tested with v0.7.4)

> Android

- Android 6.0 or higher

## Characteristics

> Exciting ✨

- Connect to the [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com/) instance or your own hosted instance
- A unique, sexy and sleek design, based on the [Material Design](https://material.io/) language
- Support for Deep Link to easily deactivate aliases from the email banner
- Lock the app using Biometrics
- App exclusive features like watching aliases for new emails
- Enable error logging to *locally* store exceptions for easy troubleshooting
- Widgets!

> Seriously 👓

- **Security**.
 - Encrypted preferences, your API key and other AnonAddy related settings are securely stored on your device using the [AndroidX crypto library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/security) - No stats, buried points or Device IDs, or even crash reporting (so if you get a crash, please share the crash info with me >_<). - I am forgoing the convenient third-party collection SDK and various stats just so you can use it with confidence.  **What's yours is yours**.

 > Manage (add, edit, delete)

- Aliases
- Recipients
- Domains
- Usernames
- Rules
