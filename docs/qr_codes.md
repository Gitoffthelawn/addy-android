# AnonAddy for Android setup QR

AnonAddy for Android has a QR scanner allowing users to quickly setup the app without having to copy the API key to their phone

## QR format

Any QR code generated in the following format would work, please make sure to generate the QR in a decent-high resolution (preferably SVG)

```
<<HOST_NAME>>;<<API_KEY>>
```

- HOST_NAME: The base URL of the AnonAddy instance
- API_KEY: The API key generated
