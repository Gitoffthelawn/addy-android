# AnonAddy for Android setup QR  
  
AnonAddy for Android has a QR scanner allowing users to quickly setup the app without having to copy the API key to their phone  
  
## QR format  
  
Any QR code generated in the following format would work, please make sure to generate the QR in a decent-high resolution (preferably SVG)  
  
```  
<<HOST_NAME>>;<<API_KEY>>  
```  
  
- HOST_NAME: The base URL of the AnonAddy instance  
- API_KEY: The API key generated
